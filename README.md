Hi my name is xleb.
I have been building websites since 2018.
Participated in the development of more than 100 Internet projects as a designer, developer, project manager and development manager.

I help bring ideas and designs to life on the web.
I create websites quickly, cross-browser and adaptively.
I am always open to new solutions and communication, I study new approaches and technologies in the field of web development.
In my work I can use English-language resources and technical documentation.
I also work at Glitch hosting https://glitch.com/@xleb

I can be contacted by mail xleb@xleb.ml.
